            <h2>Above you see various co-teaching models</h2>

            <h3>You may use one of these models in your own classroom, depending on which one suits you and your co-teacher</h3>

            <h4>The article Co-teaching to reach every year by Linda Murdoc,David Finneran and Kristin Theve introduced two co-teachers who collaborate beautifully</h4>
            <p>
            “David and Kristin work closely
with the 4th grade special education
teacher, frequently using the special
education space adjacent to the class
and making sure all students become
comfortable in both that space and the
larger classroom. Students with and
without disabilities work in mixed
groups and use both spaces.
” Pg,45

            <h3>Having a system with your Co-teacher</h3>
            <p>Having a system at play with your Co-teacher is very important. You must know what each teacher should be doing in every aspect of the classroom</p>

            <p>A perfect example is David and Kristen's transition to the next learning task.When the class switches to the next rotation, David begins a series of indi-vidual goals conferences with students.

Kristin continues her small group, but
she draws into it several students who
had been reading independently, plus
four students who’d been working
with the special education teacher.

The quote is a good depiction of how these two have developed the classroom culture and environment; every student knows where they can receive the help they need.

This is important because many co teachers are experiencing sharing their classroom and their class for the first time. This is a model that they can use to follow.
