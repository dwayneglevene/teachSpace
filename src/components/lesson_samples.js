            <h2>Below is an example of a differentiated lesson plan that I created feel free to use it if you wish</h2>

            <h3>However it is more important that you understand how to do this yourself and that is why you must consider the universal design of learning to be able to do this with ease</h3>
            <h4>Engagement,representation,and action</h4>

            <p>Always ask yourself did I provide the ability for students to interact with my lesson in multiple ways by providing a choice peaked their interest? Did I provide a video for my visual learners who have a hard time following me lecturing, and lastly did I provide opportunity for my students to recieve a feedback or a guide to push their learning in the right direction. The UDL is a great resource in your tool box.</p>


          <h5>My UDL use...</h5>
          <p>I target engagement in the very first 5 minutes of the lesson by putting it in my do now. Students are asked to read a text and analyze any character that reminds of someone in their lives. This pushes the students to connect more with the text and apply it to real life scenarios.</p>
          <p>During guided practice students read the second half of page 4, together, record the things that Helmer does towards Nora and make an inference about him based on how interacts with her.They the document these notes and inferences on the back of our chart and turn to the person next to them and turn and talk about the notes they wrote and explain their inference. If they were not able to create an inference, they listen to their partnerâ€™s and see if they agree.This allows for multiple methods for students to interact and learn material, one being self annotation and another being student communication. This targets representation by allowing another method of student interation with material.</p>
          <p>Lastly in independent practice I give students the chance to demonstrate their knowledge of the text by making an educated guess on the character's future</p>
