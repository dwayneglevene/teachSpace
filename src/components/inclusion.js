            <h1>Inclusion</h1>

            <h2>“Inclusive education seeks to address the learning needs of all children, with a specific focus on those who are vulnerable to marginalization and exclusion. The goal is to promote opportunities for all children to participate and be treated equally.” ~ Andie Fong Toy </h2>

            <p>The first step in this tool kit is to stress the importance of inclusion in your classroom. During your career you will come in contact with students who learn differently in your class and it is your duty to make sure you meet the needs of their education</p>

            <h3>Busting Myths about Differentiated Instruction</h3>
           <h4> This article is a must read by Rick Wormeli.This dicsusses the misconceptions in differentiation and dubunks myths that many may have.Here are a few that we must ignore in order to provide an inclusive education</h4>
           <ul>
            <li>
                Myth 1: Students will be unprepared for test
            </li>
            <li>
            Myth 4: Lack of Mastery at the Same Time as Classmates Means Lack of Credit
            </li>

            <li>
            Myth 5: "I Taught It. It's Up to Students to Learn It."
            </li>
           </ul>

           <p>
           The myth that students will be unprepared for standerdized test stems from the belief that differention leads to students being less equipped. This is a false narrative because the content that students recieve, differentiated or not is what they will be tested on. The only difference is that a specific set of student will recieved a  delivery of content tailored to their educational needs. Also in many cases differentiation helps when it can be applied to these exams. For example if the exam states that the response format to a question doesnt matter; this is the perfect opportunity for students to apply what they are best at. As stated in the article ," Let them conduct a debate or create a coloring book on the topic, or let them take the test orally. The goal is to get an accurate rendering of mastery. If a student can express what he or she knows more accurately by using an alternative format, get out of their way and let them do it. " - Rick Wormeli
